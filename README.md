# Accessible SAIL
Checklist and examples for accessibility best practices with Appian [SAIL low-code framework](https://docs.appian.com/suite/help/24.1/sail/home.html).

## Work with site preview using the GitHub Codespaces remote dev environment
This project is configured to work with Codespaces. This allows you work on variations of the site in a remote dev environment in your browser so you can try things out without publishing directly to the live, `main` branch.

To use this option, select `Open in a codespace` from the `Use this template` menu button.

For more information, see the [GitHub documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/codespaces/developing-in-codespaces/creating-a-codespace-from-a-template#creating-a-codespace-from-a-template-repository).

## What to do if you're having problems
- Try starting over with a new repository and follow the instructions again.
- If it's still not working, [create an issue in the original Plain Vanilla GitHub Pages repo](https://github.com/lowcodelounge/plain-vanilla-gh-pages/issues), and I'll try to help.
